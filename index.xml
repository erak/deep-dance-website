      <description>Enter the hermetically soft world of code. Human, Transhuman. Machine learning. Dance. Computation. Creativity. Prediction. Soft-ware. Choreography.Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>

      <description>In Deep.Dance, a team of international artists replaces itself with an artificial intelligence. A complete choreography, created by an artificial neural network that they programmed, is executed down to the last detail by three dancers. The strangely familiar movements open up an emphatic view into the hyper-logical world of code and confront the viewers with a construct that is accessible to few people and yet determines our future. The Hamburg based choreographer Jascha Viehst√§dt creates a silent and soft world of statistically predetermined movements that makes tangible what it means to have human creativity computed by a machine.</description>
